# datasets
## Intro
This is a collection of various datasets that can be used for machine learning
applications. More details may be found
[here](http://techtorials.me/python-machine-learning-datasets/).
## Prerequisites
[Python 2.7.X](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-279/) (all other
versions are untested)

[Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)

If you are new to Python, it is recommended that you use the following
procedure to obtain the dependencies:

1) If you don't have pip (check in your Python27/Scripts folder) obtain it
from [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html).
2) Install the dependencies using pip:
pip install numpy

## Usage
Download this repo and inside the "src" folder execute `python setup.py
install`.

This package is platform independent, and should work on any system running
Python 2.7.X.
